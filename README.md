# Robo-Wars

**Robo-Wars** is a Unity-built experimental game originally developed as a personal learning project in game development. It represents my early exploration into interactive design, Unity workflows, and gameplay mechanics implementation. This project demonstrates fundamental game structure, asset integration, and build deployment while highlighting my growth as a developer.

## 🚀 About

Robo-Wars was my **first published Unity game**, created as a practice project to gain hands-on experience with game development. The game served as a sandbox for experimenting with Unity features, lighting, asset management, and simple gameplay logic.

The project was later revisited to improve playability (such as brightness and audio adjustments), while preserving its original learning-focused design.

- Built using the **Unity game engine**
- Core gameplay mechanics (movement, interactions, game state management)
- Basic UI and visual presentation
- WebGL build support for browser play
- Organized Unity project structure
- Early-stage **C# scripting** for gameplay logic
